## Cube construction

- The program is to construct a cube picture (in command window or txt file) according to the matrix in the program.
- The program is written by C.
- Similar to NOIP 2008 the last problem.
- The main concept is to create a map big enough to draw.
- For convenience, I only provide the input within the program. If you like, you can create a input by scanf or other things.
- Hope you enjoy it!
